**Platform:** Burno.xyz  
**Token Ticker:** $BURNO  
**Total Supply:** 100,000,000 (Fixed)


## Abstract

Burno.xyz introduces **$BURNO** as Kaspa's decentralized trust protocol—a utility token crafted to reward contributions, verify project authenticity, and govern ecosystem growth. With a fixed supply and burn-integrated mechanics, $BURNO aligns incentives across users, developers, and investors to build a sustainable and transparent future for Kaspa.

## 1. Introduction

Kaspa’s rapidly growing ecosystem—featuring over 1,000 KRC-20 tokens and countless new projects—faces growing pains:

- Users are frequently misled by scams and unverified tokens.
- Information is fragmented, slowing down adoption and innovation.
- A trust protocol is missing—there’s no unified governance or validation layer.

**Burno.xyz** solves these challenges. As a decentralized information hub for Kaspa, it is powered by **$BURNO**, enabling real-time tracking, verified project listings, community rewards, and decentralized governance.


## 2. Vision & Mission

### Vision
To become Kaspa's decentralized trust and information layer.

### Mission
To aggregate, amplify, and accelerate the Kaspa ecosystem via:
- Real-time token tracking
- Community-curated insights
- Transparent governance


## 3. What is $BURNO?

**$BURNO** is a KRC-20 utility token that powers the Burno.xyz platform. It represents reputation, access, and governance within the ecosystem. 

### Key Attributes:
- **Fixed Supply:** 100,000,000 tokens
- **Non-inflationary:** No minting beyond genesis
- **Burn Mechanism:** Revenue-based deflation

## 4. Core Use Cases

### 1. Community Rewards
$BURNO incentivizes active participation in the Kaspa ecosystem by rewarding contributors who:

Rewards are distributed based on peer validation and activity logs. This ensures that contributors are recognized for maintaining trust and transparency.

Projects wishing to appear on Burno.xyz must pay a listing fee in $BURNO. The listing process includes:

**Burn Mechanism:** 50% of the listing fee is permanently burned, reducing total supply and increasing scarcity.

### 4. Governance
In the DAO phase, $BURNO holders can:
- Vote on new platform features
- Allocate community treasury funds

- Set curation standards

Governance power is proportional to staked tokens, empowering long-term holders.

### 5. Developer Tools
$BURNO is required to unlock premium developer features:
- API keys and rate limits
- SDK downloads
- Token data stream access

This creates a recurring use case for third-party developers and data consumers.

### 6. Tipping & Boosting
Users can tip creators, validators, or boost visibility for specific listings by using micro-payments in $BURNO. This creates a self-sustaining ecosystem of recognition and promotion.
