# Content Monetization on Burno.xyz

Burno.xyz aims to empower the Kaspa community by enabling high-quality educational content creation. Through a decentralized, community-approved process, content creators can earn $BURNO, while validators and approvers (Burno DAO members) also benefit. This ensures quality, trust, and incentive alignment—without applying the burn model to creators.

---

## 1. Paid Courses (On-Demand)

### What it is:
- High-quality courses submitted by verified educators or community members.
- Courses can include video tutorials, step-by-step guides, or code walkthroughs.

### Content Approval Process:
- Every course must be **approved by Burno Governance (DAO)** before publication.
- A set of **validators (staked $BURNO holders)** review and approve content based on:
  - Accuracy
  - Value to the community
  - Originality

### Pricing:
- Standard Course: **300 $BURNO**
- Bundle (3-course pack): **750 $BURNO**

### Revenue Distribution:
| Recipient                  | Share (%) |
|---------------------------|-----------|
| Content Creator           | 80%       |
| DAO Approvers (Validators) | 10%       |
| Burno Platform Treasury   | 10%       |

> *No $BURNO is burned in content monetization. Burn only applies to project listings.*

## 2. Creator Revenue Share (Tip-Based Model)

### What it is:
- Anyone can post tutorials, articles, or guides on Burno.
- Viewers can **tip creators** with any amount of $BURNO to show appreciation.

### Approval:
- Tipping content must be reviewed and published by validators.
- Prevents scams, spam, or AI-generated junk.

### Revenue Distribution:
| Recipient                  | Share (%) |
|---------------------------|-----------|
| Creator                   | 85%       |
| Approvers (DAO validators) | 10%       |
| Platform Treasury         | 5%        |

## How Content Approval Works (Governance-Based)

1. **Submission**: A creator submits new content (course, article, tutorial).
2. **Review**: DAO members (staked $BURNO holders) review for:
   - Educational value
   - Accuracy
   - Originality
   - Community relevance
3. **Approval**: If approved by at least **3–5 validators**, content goes live.
4. **Revenue Split**: When revenue is earned (tips, purchases, subscriptions):
   - Approving validators share 10% of that revenue equally.
