# Project Listings Fee – Burno.xyz

Burno.xyz provides verified, transparent listings for projects building on the Kaspa ecosystem. To maintain quality and reduce spam, every project must pay a small fee in $BURNO tokens. These fees also help sustain the platform, reward curators, and apply deflationary pressure through a burn mechanism.

## Why Listing Fees Matter

- Prevents spam and low-quality submissions  
- Signals seriousness from project teams  
- Funds platform development and operations  
- Incentivizes the community to participate in moderation and validation  
- Supports deflation of the $BURNO token through scheduled burns

## Pricing Structure

Given that $BURNO has a fixed supply of 100,000,000 tokens—and only a portion is circulating initially—we've kept the pricing accessible to encourage early adoption while preserving token value and utility.

### Standard Listing Fee: `1,500 $BURNO`

- **Burned:** 750 $BURNO (50%)
- **Distributed:** 
  - 450 $BURNO to validators/community moderators (30%)

## Economic Model and Sustainability

$BURNO has a total fixed supply of 100,000,000 tokens with the following allocation:

| Category                | Allocation | Vesting Schedule             |
|------------------------|------------|------------------------------|
| Community Incentives   | 35M        | Linear over 4 years          |
| Fair Launch            | 25M        | Immediate                    |
| Ecosystem Growth Fund  | 20M        | Linear over 2 years          |
| Burn Reserve Vault     | 10M        | Locked for protocol use      |
| Core Team              | 5M         | 12-month cliff + 24M vesting |
| Treasury & Operations  | 5M         | Linear over 24 months        |

By setting the listing fee in a modest range of 1,500 to 3,000 $BURNO, we:
- Keep it affordable for serious teams, even early on
- Encourage listings while maintaining quality
- Apply consistent burn pressure, reducing circulating supply over time

## Sample Projection

If 1,000 projects list within the first year:

- Total Fees Collected: ~2,000,000 $BURNO
- Total Burned: ~1,000,000 $BURNO
- Remaining 1,000,000 distributed to validators and treasury

This model aligns with Burno’s goals: sustainability, decentralization, and value creation for the Kaspa ecosystem.
